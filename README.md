Attempt to create nice contribution art 

## Motivation
I came accross to a linkdein post where an author shared nice doller sign in his github contribution chart.

This caught my eyes and being a git enthusiast, I was wondering if I could also draw some art here. This will be very long and painfull process (maybe not that painfull but preparing for worst).

## Idea
As per contribution calculation logic [link](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile), I can just create commits for specific date and contribution points will be added on that day (*utc only*). 

Now I can just run a cron job everyday. That job will commit appropriate number of commit in some private repo. But after just one google search, I found a repo that generate contribution in the **past!** [github-activity-generator](https://github.com/Shpota/github-activity-generator)

I am not surprised because it is possible to spoof commit data. I had a similar experiment here [childhood-codes](https://github.com/mahdihasnat/childhood-codes). I just created a commit for year 2004.

Contribution graph is generated for a year. There are 7 rows. Row starts at sunday. There will be 365[+1 if leap year] data points. Each cell can contain one of the 5 different color. From black to green. 

So my contribution for year 2017 is completely empty:

I want to find the formula how github calculates the weight of individual cells. To test that I am going to add 1 commit in first day, 2 commit in second day and so on for 365 days of 2017.
Yes I pushed 66,795 commits to my private repo. But apparently github only counted last 1000 commits for 2017.

I was wondering where is the color level decision taken? I checked the network tab and saw this tag comes from server. So the decision code is in the server.

I will just need to test for few days. So now I will test for 43 days. There will be (1 + 2 + 3 + .. + 43) = 43 * 44 / 2 = 43 * 22 = 946 contributions [ yay it is less than 1000].
I tested with few fix max contributions. (eg. 34, 40, 41, 42, 43).

After analyzing these results I came up with a function to get levels based on contribution.

https://github.com/mahdihasnat/contribution-art-maker/blob/87c3f3bf4e1ddea310e9689ff544830e32e525fa/formula-verifier.js#L1-L26

Though this formula works for ideal cases I generated, but I really should test this formula for other existing pages. So here is a validator function that visits all the cells and validate the level with my implementation. 

https://github.com/mahdihasnat/contribution-art-maker/blob/87c3f3bf4e1ddea310e9689ff544830e32e525fa/formula-verifier.js#L1-L47

I was hoping that this will pass for every year, but alas!. There are exceptions in some year. For example in 2018, I have 3 days with [4,4,1] contributions. Here my formula suggests the levels will be [4,4,2]. But actual levels were [4,4,4]. ðŸ¤¦

Anyway, I am going to stick to my formula hoping that it will be correct for majority of the cases.

First time when I tried to color every 365 days, I just got color for last few days. To be exact , contribution for last 1000 comiits. So What if instead of single push after all commits, I will push after every 1000 commit. I tried and actually worked! ðŸŽ‰

Now I got the secret to arbitrarily add any number of contribution to the year.

This is my current contribution chart for year 2020. There are different contribution for each day. I want to erase all the existing contribution from this chard. Obviously I don't want to temper the commit date of my existing codes. One idea is to make extra commit on each day such that every day has same number of commits. So I tried that with a little bit of script as the following. You can run this script on dev-tools/console on your github profile page and selecting proper year. After you run the js script, a bash script will be downloaded. Just run the bash script at any of your repository. Tip: you should create a private repository so that you can undoe the contributions by deleteing the repository.

Voila! what a nice green valley ðŸ’š
